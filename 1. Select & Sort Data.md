## 1. Chapter 1: Select & Sort Data

### When first inspecting a dataset, NEVER EVER use a `SELECT * FROM some_big_sales_table` without a `LIMIT`- restricting the output. Might crash the entire system if it's a really big table, otherwise.
```sql
SELECT * FROM some_big_sales_table
LIMIT 5;

```

### By default PostgreSQL will put all null values last unless specified with a `NULLS FIRST` after `ORDER BY`

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table1
ORDER BY 1 NULLS FIRST;

```

### Text fields will be ordered alphabetically; however, be careful when it starts with a number of non-alphabetic characters.

Try to run this code and guess the order of the raw values. Which value comes first: text starting with space ' ', special character '*', or '0'?
```sql
WITH test_data (sample_values) AS (
  VALUES
    (null),
    (' 0123'),
    ('*012'),
    ('0123'),
    ('abc'),
    (' bca')
)
SELECT
  *
FROM
  test_data
ORDER BY 1;
```

### Use `OFFSET [number` if you want to skip some rows before beginning to return rows. Omitting `OFFSET` clause is the same as `OFFSET 0` or `OFFSET NULL` - skipping no rows.
