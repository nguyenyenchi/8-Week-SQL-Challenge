## 3. Chapter 3: Identifying duplicate records

### How to identify duplicate records in a table?

### Remove all duplicate records from a dataset using DISTINCT
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM table;
```

### Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries or temporary tables to calculate unique record counts in a table

#### Use CTEs
```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT *
  FROM table;
  )

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM cte;  
```
#### Use subqueries
```sql

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM
(
  SELECT DISTINCT *
  FROM table;
) AS subquery -- Note subquery must always has an alias followed by `AS`
;  
```

#### Create temporary tables using the results from a SELECT statement
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_table;

CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_table AS
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM table;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM temp_table;
```

#### When to use which option?
- If you need the table with only distinct records later, opt for temporary tables; otherwise, choose CTEs instead of subqueries for better readability.

### Detect the presence of duplicates by comparing basic record counts with unique counts
- `COUNT(*)` gives total of records, while the above methods give the total of unique records. Compare the two and you'll know if there are duplicates in the table.

### Identify exact duplicate records using a `GROUP BY` and `COUNT(*)` as aggregate function on all columns in a table

```sql
SELECT c1, c2, c3,
      COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM table
GROUP BY c1, c2, c3
ORDER BY frequency DESC
```
- This query tells how many times each row appear in the dataset. Using `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` after `GROUP BY` will return the duplicate records.
