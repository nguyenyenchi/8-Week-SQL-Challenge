## 2. Chapter 2: Record Counts & Distinct Values

### Initial questions to ask when inspecting a dataset
- How many rows are there? - Use `COUNT(*)`
- Questions relating to Frequency:
  - How many unique values are there in a specific column? - Use `DISTINCT`
  - What is the count of unique values in a column? - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT col1)`
  - What is the count for multiple column combinations? - Use `GROUP BY col1, col2`
  - What is the proportion of a unique value relative to total count? For example, a column of school A, school B,... What is the percentage of school A? - Use window functions together with aggregate function

```sql
SELECT
  school,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency,
  COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS percentage
FROM table
GROUP BY school
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

### Purpose of `GROUP BY` and aggregate function
- When use `GROUP BY` with an aggregate function e.g. COUNT, SUM, the dataset is first split into groups, then the aggregate function will be applied to these groups, condensing it to ONLY a single row output for each group.

### How to avoid floor division when divide an `INT` by `INT`?
- By default, when you divide an `INT` by `INT`, the result is rounded down to the nearest integer, which is called floor division. For example, 7 / 3 should give you 2.3333...; instead, you'll get 2. To avoid this, simply cast either the numerator or denominator to a `NUMERIC` data type with `CAS(col1 AS NUMERIC)` or `col1::NUMERIC` and you'll get a float number result instead.
